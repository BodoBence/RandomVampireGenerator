                <p>
                    AutoFeed is developed by Bence Levente Bodó, a fan of the tabletop role-playing game, Vampire: the Masquerade.
                    It is intended as a free-to-use tool for a smooth randomized narrative experience. Naturally, it is storytellers who will probably benefit the most from it, but don't let that discourage you from sinking your fangs in it for player character inspiration!

                <p>Automatic XP Calculation</p>
                <p>
                    AutoFeed starts character generation with a fixed amount of 400 XP points. From there they live their simulated unlife, gathering experience every year. While getting older, they get less and less XP points (see below), emulating how eventually there will be nothing new under the Sun. Reaching the maximum age of 3000 years the vampire will have accumulated a total of circa 1600 XP points. XP points are spent according to the normal rules of the 5th edition handbook.
