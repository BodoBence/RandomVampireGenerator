https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	2	Shadow Cast: The vampire summons a supernatural shadow from Oblivion, one which they control and can only be destroyed by sunlight.

https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	2	Fatal Precognition: The vampire's eyes become black and they remain still while they scry a vision which shows the death of a non-Kindred they can percieve.

https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	2	Where the Shroud Thins: The vampire determines the density of the local Shroud, learning whether ghosts (and Kindred with the right Ceremony) may cross between worlds here, how difficult uses of Oblivion are, and whether mortals are at risk. They do not learn the cause of the Shroud's condition, simply what it is.
https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	3	Shadow Perspective: The vampire casts their senses to a shadow they can see, maintaining both their mundane senses and their shadow perspective.

https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	3	Touch of Oblivion: The vampire touches their victim and channels the raw entropic power of Oblivion through them. The victim suffers aggravated damage, and a crippling injury (blindness, muteness, a ruined limb, or the like).

https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	4	Necrotic Plague: With a touch, the vampire may poison a mortal's blood using the pure pollutant of Oblivion. This horrific disease ravages their body and risks becoming contagious.
https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	5	Shadow Step: The vampire disappears into shadow, skating across the Labyrinth to reemerge after travelling across something fouler than death and twice as hungry.

https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	5	Tenebrous Avatar: The vampire becomes a sentient patch of two-dimensional darkness, immune to damage except fire and sunlight. While in this shadow state they can pass through anything not hermetically sealed, are immune to most harms as described above, and can envelop others to feed without breaking the skin. Those enveloped by a vampire using Tenebrous Avatar suffer the effects of Stygian Shroud.
https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Oblivion_(Discipline)	Oblivion	skill	5	Skuld Fulfilled: The vampire coats their palms and face with blood, recalling the faces of their victims and reintroducing old illnesses with new fury.
